# Grapher
Grapher that uses wxWidgets API and  an equation parser

The wxGraph.cpp is not polishes and minimal time was spent getting it to work.
I was mostly testing and learning how to use wxWidgets.
I already had a completed equation parser, so I thought it would be a good way to 
create a visual grapher and learn about a GUI API, wxWidgets.

To Compile and run, type "make run" in terminal at file directory
To graph an equation, click in the bottom left field and type an equation.

examples. 
"y = 3 * x + 4" 
"y = x ^ 3 + 9" 
"y = x ^ .5" 

Note: you must use a space after every character and tig functions are not supported.
